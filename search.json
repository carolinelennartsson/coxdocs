To do so the column “Reverse” needs to be selected, “+” is the value we are looking for and is selected by default.

So we are more curious about the intensity profile of all the samples. The results will be displayed in an extra tab on the same matrix containing the hierarchical clustering functionalities.\n\nThe default color gradient is from green (low values) to red (high values), which is very nice for ratios, but for intensities another color gradient could be used, which is called “rainbow gradient”. It goes from dark cold colors to bright warm colors. To change it click on the “change color gradient” button in the “Clustering” tab (highlighted by a red rectangle) and the current gradient will be displayed in a pop-up window.\n\nTo change the colors just click on the position in the gradient you want to change and select a color in the “Color” window that pops up until you have the gradient you desire.\n\nAt first glance all the samples look more or less the same, which is good. But, if we take a closer look at the top of the heatmap, we can find a group of proteins that show distinct behavior between the groups. To figure out which proteins these are we have to zoom in by holding the left mouse key and dragging. And what we can see is that the highlighted cluster of proteins belong mainly to anaphase promoting complex.\n\nNow we can investigate the behavior of the contaminants, since we deliberately did not filter them in the beginning. To highlight them we have to click on the “Configure row names” button in the “Clustering” tab\n\nand change “Row color bar” to “Contaminant”.\n\nThis results in an additional column on the left hand side of the heatmap, where contaminants are highlighted in blue (the rest is grey). These contaminants do not behave like a contaminant and are thus potential interaction partners."

This is done by using the function Processing → Filter rows → Filter rows based on categorical column, because both the “Reverse” column and the “Only identified by site” column are categorical.\n\nFirst, we filter out the reverse hits. Reverse hits are indicated by a “+” in the “Reverse” column, so to filter out these hits all rows containing a “+” will be removed from the matrix. Therefore, the column “Reverse” needs to be selected, “+” is the value we are looking for and is selected by default. No further changes need to be applied, because we want to remove the matching rows from the matrix. This results in a matrix, where the value in the “Reverse” column of all rows is empty.\n\nSecond, we filter out the hits that are only identified by site. The column “Only identified by site” has two values, TRUE and FALSE. Thus all rows containing TRUE are filtered out. Therefore, “Only identified by site” has to be selected as column and TRUE is the value of interest, which is selected by clicking on TRUE on the left hand side and using the button in the middle with the arrow to the right on it. Deselection works by using the button with the arrow to the left. No further changes are necessary, because we want to remove the matching rows from the matrix. This results in a matrix, where all rows contain the value FALSE in the column “Only identified by site”.\n\nThe next step is to filter out all rows with less than six valid intensity values of all nine (i.e. being not NaN). Therefore we use Processing → Filter rows → Filter rows based on valid values.\n\nThe required percentage of valid values per row may differ from study to study. In some cases, having valid values only in one of several replicate groups might be a significant finding and these kind of rows should possibly not be discarded. The filter can also be applied to each column group separately. (How to create column groups or categorical annotation rows you will learn in a few steps.) Now we just want to be certain that each row contains at least six of the nine intensity values."

    "text": "5.1 In-Vivo Quantitative Proteomics Reveals a Key Contribution of Post-Transcriptional Mechanisms to the Circadian Regulation of Liver Metabolism\nThe algorithms were first applied in 2014 by Robles et. al.1.\nAbstract\nCircadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that drive the rhythmic expression of a broad array of genes, orchestrating metabolism and physiology. Recent evidence indicates that post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play essential roles in modulating temporal gene expression for proper circadian function, particularly for the molecular mechanism of the clock. Due to technical limitations in large-scale, quantitative protein measurements, it remains unresolved to what extent the circadian clock regulates metabolism by driving rhythms of protein abundance. Therefore, we aimed to identify global circadian oscillations of the proteome in the mouse liver by applying in vivo SILAC mouse technology in combination with state of the art mass spectrometry. Among the 3000 proteins accurately quantified across two consecutive cycles, 6% showed circadian oscillations with a defined phase of expression. Interestingly, daily rhythms of one fifth of the liver proteins were not accompanied by changes at the transcript level. The oscillations of almost half of the cycling proteome were delayed by more than six hours with respect to the corresponding, rhythmic mRNA. Strikingly we observed that the length of the time lag between mRNA and protein cycles varies across the day. Our analysis revealed a high temporal coordination in the abundance of proteins involved in the same metabolic process, such as xenobiotic detoxification. Apart from liver specific metabolic pathways, we identified many other essential cellular processes in which protein levels are under circadian control, for instance vesicle trafficking and protein folding. Our large-scale proteomic analysis reveals thus that circadian post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play a key role in the temporal orchestration of liver metabolism and physiology."

    "section": "5.1 Support vector machines",
    "text": "5.1 Support vector machines\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) were largely developed in the 1990s by Vapnik and co-workers on a basis of a separable bipartition problem at the AT & T Bell Laboratories (see2. SVMs are a family of data analysis algorithms, based on convex quadratic programming, whose successful use has been demonstrated in classification, regression and clustering problems. Thus, SVMs are now the state-of-the-art tools for non-linear input-output knowledge. The following section covers a brief and basic description of SVMs, but detailed explanations can be found in V. N. Vapniks3, N. Cristianinis and J. Shawe-Taylors4, V. N. Vapniks5, V. N. Vapniks6, B. E. Bosers, I. M. Guyons, and V. N. Vapniks7.\nSVMs are a particular class of supervised learning methods that are well suited for analyses of data in high-dimensional feature spaces. They are computationally efficient and capable of detecting biologically-relevant signals. SVMs revolve around the notion of a margin - either side of a data separating linear decision boundary (hyperplane). Maximizing this margin and thereby creating the largest distance between two classes as well as between the hyperplane and the instances on either side, is the main task in training SVMs (see figure below). Thus, these models have a binary nature to separate classes, but can be extended to multi-class problems by reducing the problem to a set of multiple binary classification problems. The hyperplane is defined by:\n \\[\\begin{align}\nD(x)  =  &lt;\\omega,x&gt;  +  b\n\\end{align}\\] \nwhere \\(ω\\) is the weights vector and \\(b\\) is a bias value (or \\(−b\\) the threshold).\nIn case an optimal separating hyperplane is found, data points on the margin are known as support vectors and the solution is a linear combination of them (red data points in figure below). Each new data point is then classified according to its optimal position relative to the model’s hyperplane. So the model complexity is unaffected by the number of features encountered in the training data, therefore SVMs are well suited to deal with learning tasks with a large number of features compared to the number of data points. In case no hyperplane can be found, the problem can be addressed using the so-called soft margin. The margin optimization constraints can be relaxed by allowing some misclassifications or margin violations in the training set, to get better generalization of the SVM than using a hard margin. The choice of appropriate penalties is mandatory:\n \\[\\begin{align}\nmin_{\\omega,b,\\xi} ~& \\frac{1}{2} \\ \\omega^{T}\\omega \\ + \\ C\\sum_{i=1}^{l}\\xi_{i} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} ~& y_{i}(\\omega^{T}x_{i}+b) \\ &lt; \\ 1-\\xi_{i} \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\xi \\geq 0\n\\end{align}\\] \nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is the weights vector, \\(b\\) is a bias value, \\(C\\) is a penalty constant, and \\(\\xi\\) is a slack variable, which is the orthogonal distance between a data point and the hyperplane. Large C correspond to large penalties for misclassification and resemble a hard margin classifier, whereas \\(\\xi\\) measures the degree of misclassification or margin violation. This is a good way to deal with outliers in the data set without destroying the model by tailoring it perfectly to the input data.\nNevertheless, most real-world data sets involve separation problems that are linearly non-separable, which requires the definition of complex functions to build a good classifier. SVMs use kernels, a special class of functions to deal with such situations. Mapping the data points to a higher-dimensional space (transformed feature space) using kernels, enables the definition of a linear hyperplane, which results in a non-linear hyperplane in the original space. The hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional space are represented by all points defining a set, whose inner product with a vector is constant in that space. Training the classifier depends only on the data through dot products, which are possible to compute even at a high-dimension at low cost by applying the so-called kernel trick. The trick lies in working in an higher-dimensional space, without ever explicitly transforming the original data points into that space, but instead relying on algorithms that only need to compute inner products within that space. These algorithms are identical to kernels and can thus be cheaply computed in the original space. So, everything about linear cases can also be applied to non-linear ones using an appropriate kernel function. It is common practice to find the best suiting function by cross-validation. Some popular kernels, which are all included in Perseus, are:\n \\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{linear:} \\ K(x,y)         &= x^{T}y  \\\\\n\\text{sigmoid:} \\ K(x,y)    &= tanh(\\gamma x^{T}y \\ + \\ r) \\\\\n\\text{radial basis:} \\ K(x,y)   &= \\exp(-\\gamma|x \\ - \\ y|^{2}) , \\ \\gamma &gt; 0 \\\\\n\\text{polynomial:} \\ K(x,y)     &= (\\gamma x^{T}y \\ + \\ r)^{d}, \\ \\gamma &gt; 0\n\\end{align}\\] \nwhere \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two data points, \\(\\gamma\\) is the slope, \\(d\\) is the degree of the polynom, and \\(r\\) is a constant.\n\n\n\nIllustration of separating two classes using SVMs. Linear (A.) and non-linear (B.) perfect separation of two classes (green and orange) with a hyperplane (black) and maximal margin (blue and dotted gray lines). Support vectors defining the hyperplane are in red. No misclassifiactions or margin violations are included.\n\n\nFor more information you can also consult Wikipedia."

    "text": "5.2 Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), is a well-known classification technique that has been used successfully in many statistical pattern recognition problems. It was developed by R.A. Fisher, a professor of statistics at University College London, and is sometimes called Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA). Its first description was in 1936 and can be found in8.\nThe primary purpose of LDA is to separate samples of two or multiple distinct groups while preserving as much of the class discriminatory information as possible to classify new unseen instances. The approach of the LDA is to project all the data points into new space, normally of lower dimension, which maximizes the between-class separability while minimizing their within-class variability. So the goal is to find the best projection axes for separating the classes. In general the number of axes that can be computed by the LDA method is one less than the number of classes in the problem.\n\n\n\nIllustration of separating two classes using LDA. Classes are separated perfectly and the dimensionality of the problem has been reduced from two features (x1,x2) to only a scalar value y.\n\n\nFor more information you can also consult Wikipedia."

    "text": "5.3 k-nearest neighbors\nK-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a simple lazy learner algorithm that stores all available data points and classifies new instances based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). It corresponds to the group of supervised learning algorithms and has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970’s as a non-parametric technique. During the training phase the algorithm simply stores the data points including their class labels and all computation is deferred until the classification process. So kNN is based on the principle that instances that are in close proximity to another have similar properties. Thus, to classify new unclassified instances, one simply has to look at their k-nearest neighbors, to figure out the classification label. The class membership can be defined by a majority vote of the k closest neighbors or the neighbors can be ranked and weighted according to their distance to the new instance. A common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.\n\n\n\nIllustration of classifying a new item using kNN. Using a majority vote of the k nearest neighbors, the defined k can change the assigned class of the red star. If k = 3 (purple circle) the star corresponds to the blue polygon class, because the three closest neighbors include two blue polygons and one green rectangle. Whereas, if k = 5 (black circle) the star is assigned to the green class, because the five closest neighbors include more green rectangles than blue polygons (three green rectangles vs. two blue polygons).\n\n\nFor more information you can also consult Wikipedia."

B. Kotsiantis [[http://citeseer.uark.edu:8080/citeseerx/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.95.9683|Supervised Machine Learning: A Review of Classification Techniques]]). //SVMs// are a family of data analysis algorithms, based on convex quadratic programming, whose successful use has been demonstrated in classification, regression and clustering problems. Thus, //SVMs// are now the state-of-the-art tools for non-linear input-output knowledge. The following section covers a brief and basic description of //SVMs//, but detailed explanations can be found in V. N.

Vapniks [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=130385.130401|A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers]].\n//SVMs// are a particular class of supervised learning methods that are well suited for analyses of data in high-dimensional feature spaces. They are computationally efficient and capable of detecting biologically-relevant signals. //SVMs// revolve around the notion of a //margin// - either side of a data separating linear decision boundary (//hyperplane//). Maximizing this //margin// and thereby creating the largest distance between two classes as well as between the //hyperplane// and the instances on either side, is the main task in training //SVMs// (see figure below). Thus, these models have a binary nature to separate classes, but can be extended to multi-class problems by reducing the problem to a set of multiple binary classification problems. The //hyperplane// is defined by:   D(x)  =  &lt;,x&gt;  +  b   where //ω// is the weights vector and //b// is a bias value (or //−b// the threshold).\nIn case an optimal separating //hyperplane// is found, data points on the //margin// are known as //support vectors// and the solution is a linear combination of them (red data points in figure below). Each new data point is then classified according to its optimal position relative to the model’s //hyperplane//. So the model complexity is unaffected by the number of features encountered in the training data, therefore //SVMs// are well suited to deal with learning tasks with a large number of features compared to the number of data points. In case no //hyperplane// can be found, the problem can be addressed using the so-called //soft margin//. The //margin// optimization constraints can be relaxed by allowing some misclassifications or //margin// violations in the training set, to get better generalization of the //SVM// than using a //hard margin//. The choice of appropriate penalties is mandatory:   \\[\\begin{align}\nmin_{w,b,\\xi} ~& \\frac{1}{2} \\ w^{T}w \\ + \\ C\\sum_{i=1}^{l}\\xi_{i} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} ~& y_{i}(w^{T}x_{i}+b) \\ &lt; \\ 1-\\xi_{i} \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\xi \\geq 0\n\\end{align}\\]   where //ω// is the weights vector, //b// is a bias value, //C// is a penalty constant, and //ξ// is a slack variable, which is the orthogonal distance between a data point and the //hyperplane//. Large //C// correspond to large penalties for misclassification and resemble a //hard margin// classifier, whereas //ξ// measures the degree of misclassification or //margin// violation. This is a good way to deal with outliers in the data set without destroying the model by tailoring it perfectly to the input data.\nNevertheless, most real-world data sets involve separation problems that are linearly non-separable, which requires the definition of complex functions to build a good classifier. //SVMs// use kernels, a special class of functions to deal with such situations. Mapping the data points to a higher-dimensional space (transformed feature space) using kernels, enables the definition of a linear //hyperplane//, which results in a non-linear //hyperplane// in the original space. The //hyperplanes// in the higher-dimensional space are represented by all points defining a set, whose inner product with a vector is constant in that space. Training the classifier depends only on the data through dot products, which are possible to compute even at a high-dimension at low cost by applying the so-called //kernel trick//. The trick lies in working in an higher-dimensional space, without ever explicitly transforming the original data points into that space, but instead relying on algorithms that only need to compute inner products within that space. These algorithms are identical to kernels and can thus be cheaply computed in the original space. So, everything about linear cases can also be applied to non-linear ones using an appropriate kernel function. It is common practice to find the best suiting function by cross-validation. Some popular kernels, which are all included in Perseus, are:   \\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{linear:} \\ K(x,y)         &= x^{T}y  \\\\\n\\text{sigmoid:} \\ K(x,y)    &= tanh(\\gamma x^{T}y \\ + \\ r) \\\\\n\\text{radial basis:} \\ K(x,y)   &= \\exp(-\\gamma|x \\ - \\ y|^{2}) , \\ \\gamma &gt; 0 \\\\\n\\text{polynomial:} \\ K(x,y)     &= (\\gamma x^{T}y \\ + \\ r)^{d}, \\ \\gamma &gt; 0\n\\end{align}\\]   where //x// and //y// are two data points, //γ// is the slope, //d// is the degree of the polynom, and //r// is a constant.\n{{ perseus:user:activities:matrixprocessing:learning:svm.png?direct |}} Illustration of separating two classes using SVMs. Linear (A.) and non-linear (B.) perfect separation of two classes (green and orange) with a hyperplane (black) and maximal margin (blue and dotted gray lines). Support vectors defining the hyperplane are in red. No misclassifiactions or margin violations are included.\nFor more information you can also consult [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine|Wikipedia]].\n\\ \\ \\\n==== Fisher’s linear discriminant analysis ==== Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), is a well-known classification technique that has been used successfully in many statistical pattern recognition problems. It was developed by R. A. Fisher, a professor of statistics at University College London, and is sometimes called Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA). Its first description was in 1936 and can be found in [[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x/abstract;jsessionid=B987772120350C4E7E8866F341404E7B.f01t01|The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems]].\nThe primary purpose of //LDA// is to separate samples of two or multiple distinct groups while preserving as much of the class discriminatory information as possible to classify new unseen instances. The approach of the //LDA // is to project all the data points into new space, normally of lower dimension, which maximizes the between-class separability while minimizing their within-class variability. So the goal is to find the best projection axes for separating the classes. In general the number of axes that can be computed by the //LDA// method is one less than the number of classes in the problem.\n{{ perseus:user:activities:matrixprocessing:learning:lda2.png?direct |}} Illustration of separating two classes using LDA. Classes are separated perfectly and the dimensionality of the problem has been reduced from two features (x1,x2) to only a scalar value y.\nFor more information you can also consult [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis|Wikipedia]].\n\\ \\ \\ ==== k-nearest neighbors ==== K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a simple //lazy learner// algorithm that stores all available data points and classifies new instances based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). It corresponds to the group of supervised learning algorithms and has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970’s as a non-parametric technique. During the training phase the algorithm simply stores the data points including their class labels and all computation is deferred until the classification process. So //kNN// is based on the principle that instances that are in close proximity to another have similar properties. Thus, to classify new unclassified instances, one simply has to look at their k-nearest neighbors, to figure out the classification label. The class membership can be defined by a majority vote of the //k// closest neighbors or the neighbors can be ranked and weighted according to their distance to the new instance. A common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.\n{{ perseus:user:activities:matrixprocessing:learning:knn.png?direct&300 |}} Illustration of classifying a new item using kNN. Using a majority vote of the k nearest neighbors, the defined k can change the assigned class of the red star. If k = 3 (purple circle) the star corresponds to the blue polygon class, because the three closest neighbors include two blue polygons and one green rectangle. Whereas, if k = 5 (black circle) the star is assigned to the green class, because the five closest neighbors include more green rectangles than blue polygons (three green rectangles vs. two blue polygons).\nFor more information you can also consult [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm|Wikipedia]]."

    "text": "2 Raw files functions\n\n2.1 Input data group\nThe Load and Load folder buttons are described here, but you should be aware that there are two other ways to load raw files.\nOne is by loading parameters stored in an *.xml file, usually named mqpar.xml. To do this, use the Load parameters item on the drop-down menu just left of the Raw files tab. A file browser will open so you can load the parameters you want, including the raw data files.\nThe other way to load raw files is by drag-and-drop from a file explorer. The behavior will depend on what you select.\n\nIf you select a single file with an *.xml extension (usually mqpar.xml), the raw data files and other parameters stored there will be loaded.\nIf all of the items you select are recognized as raw data files, then these will be loaded.\nIf any of the items you select is not recognized as a raw data file, then each folder among the selected items will be searched recursively for raw data files. All files found will be loaded. If there are also files which are not recognized as raw data, they will be silently passed over.\n\n\n\n2.2 Load button\nPressing the Load button will open a file chooser window. The filter at the lower right may be selected to choose which type of file-based raw data source is visible and may be selected. Folder-based raw data sources cannot be loaded with this button, but the Load folder button (Section 2.4) can be used for these. The folders may be browsed and single or multiple files can be chosen in the usual way. When you have made your selection, press Open. (Remember, if you have chosen a folder, it will be opened for browsing. To load files, you must have only files selected.) The file or files chosen will be added to the table, unless they are already present there.\n\n\n2.3 Remove button\nThis button removes the selected raw data rows from the table.\n\n\n2.4 Load folder button\nThe Load folder button can be used in three ways:\n\nto open a single, folder-based raw data source,\nto open all the raw data sources of any sort (whether file-based or folder based) in the chosen folder, or\nto open all the raw data sources of any sort anywhere under the chosen folder, that is, recursively.\n\nBecause there could be many items in a directory that are not raw data sources, all such items are silently ignored.\n\n\n2.5 Change folder button\nRaw data files loaded by the buttons or with drag-and-drop will, naturally, exist. When an mqpar.xml file is loaded, however, the files mentioned may no longer exist. For example, some processing of the files may have been done and a parameter file saved, but the files subsequently moved to another folder or drive. If the files are still together, the situation may be saved by telling MaxQuant where to find them now. When you press the Change folder button you will be presented with the part of the path that the files in the table have in common and given the opportunity to change it to the path that is currently correct, either by editing or by browsing."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This Perseus plugin implements computational strategies for absolute protein quantification without spike-in standards. The concept was published by Wiśniewski et al.1 and builds on earlier work by Wiśniewski et al.2.\nUsually, determining copy numbers of proteins per cell requires the use of spike-in standards in combination with cell counting and accurate protein concentration measurements.\nIn a nutshell, the idea of the ‘proteomic ruler’ is to use a natural standard instead: Histones. Histones are wrapped around DNA at a defined ratio of ~1:1 (DNA mass/histone mass). The amount of DNA per cell is a function of genome size and ploidy and one usually has good prior knowledge of these factors. Moreover, the total protein concentration is remarkably similar in most cell types, around 200-300 g/l. One can use this to estimate not only copy numbers per cell, but also absolute protein concentrations.\n\n\n1 Requirements\nIf you want to use the proteomic ruler plugin on your dataset, you will need a deep, eukaryotic, whole proteome dataset from a nucleated cell type with known ploidy. It is important that you lysed the cells completely and that no cellular fraction was lost during sample preparation. In particular, the chromatin fraction must be included. Reasonably deep proteome coverage is required. From a depth 12,000+ peptides on, we found that the ratio of histone intensity to total intensity flattens out, assuring overall scaling accuracy. However, deeper coverage will be needed to obtain accurate copy numbers of most individual proteins.\nIf you fractionated your sample, make sure that your fractionation method does not underrepresent histones. We successfully tested SAX, SCX and in-gel fractionation, whereas isoelectric focusing (OFF-gel) fractions tends to underrepresent basic histone peptides, leading to a scaling bias.\nFor technical reasons, this plugin requires that you searched your data against a recent Uniprot fasta file. The plugin currently supports H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe.\n\n\n2 Installation\nAs with other Perseus plugins, installation is really easy:\n\nDownload the plugin .dll that is compatible with your Perseus version.\nCopy the .dll into the main Perseus folder.\nRestart Perseus.exe.\nYou should then see a new menu item ‘Proteomic ruler’ in the processing section.\n\n\n\n3 Usage\nImport the proteinGroups.txt of your dataset into Perseus. Make sure to import the following columns:\n\nIntensity (or LFQ intensity) columns as expression columns\nPeptides, unique, razor + unique peptides as numerical columns\nProtein IDs, Majority protein IDs as text columns\nSequence length, Molecular weight as numerical columns (optional)\n\nThe proteomic ruler plugin comes with three functions that should be executed in this order:\n\nAnnotate proteins\nEstimate copy numbers and concentrations\nEstimate absolute protein quantification accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "text": "5.1 In-Vivo Quantitative Proteomics Reveals a Key Contribution of Post-Transcriptional Mechanisms to the Circadian Regulation of Liver Metabolism\nThe algorithms were first applied in 2014 by Robles et. al.1.\nAbstract\nCircadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that drive the rhythmic expression of a broad array of genes, orchestrating metabolism and physiology. Recent evidence indicates that post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play essential roles in modulating temporal gene expression for proper circadian function, particularly for the molecular mechanism of the clock. Due to technical limitations in large-scale, quantitative protein measurements, it remains unresolved to what extent the circadian clock regulates metabolism by driving rhythms of protein abundance. Therefore, we aimed to identify global circadian oscillations of the proteome in the mouse liver by applying in vivo SILAC mouse technology in combination with state of the art mass spectrometry. Among the 3000 proteins accurately quantified across two consecutive cycles, 6% showed circadian oscillations with a defined phase of expression. Interestingly, daily rhythms of one fifth of the liver proteins were not accompanied by changes at the transcript level. The oscillations of almost half of the cycling proteome were delayed by more than six hours with respect to the corresponding, rhythmic mRNA. Strikingly we observed that the length of the time lag between mRNA and protein cycles varies across the day. Our analysis revealed a high temporal coordination in the abundance of proteins involved in the same metabolic process, such as xenobiotic detoxification. Apart from liver specific metabolic pathways, we identified many other essential cellular processes in which protein levels are under circadian control, for instance vesicle trafficking and protein folding. Our large-scale proteomic analysis reveals thus that circadian post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play a key role in the temporal orchestration of liver metabolism and physiology."

You can either browse through the table or use the \"Find...\" function of Andromeda by right clicking on the table and choosing it from the appearing menu. Then a pop-up window will show up and you can specify what you are searching and whether the term should be searched (parameter “Look in”) in the whole table or in a specific column. in Figure 2 we search in the “Name” column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Andromeda search modification window\n\n\n\nThe row will be selected and the settings of the modification appear on the right hand side of the Andromeda window (s. Figure 3. Only one modification is defined together for S, T and Y. This is important for the proper calculation of localization scores for phosphorylation sites. You will notice that a neutral loss of a phosphate is only defined for serine and threonine by clicking on the amino acids in the window on the right.\nA diagnostic peak of composition \\(C_8H_{10}O_4P\\) is only defined for tyrosine, which is the characteristic immonium ion for tyrosine phosphorylation. This will only be relevant for fragmentation spectra in which the lower mass range is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Andromeda modification information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we will add a new Modification. You can visit unimod.org and select a modification that has not been defined yet in MaxQuant and add this modification to the modification list in MaxQuant. Here we are adding Dehydroalanine from Tyrosine. All the information that we need can be extracted from the unimod homepage (Figure 4) like the compositional change as well as the site specificity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Information extracted from unimod can be used to add modifications to the Andromeda search\n\n\n\nFirst click the “Add” button (left side of the ribbon on Figure 5). Then a new row will be added at the end of the table and a new modification form will appear on the right hand side that can be edited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Add modification to the andromeda search\n\n\n\nThen you just have to transfer the information from the unimod table to the form.

    "text": "2.1 Input\n\n2.1.1 Protein IDs\nSelect the column containing your semicolon-separated protein group IDs (uniprot format). It is recommended to use the ‘Majority protein IDs’ when coming from MaxQuant.\n\n\n2.1.2 Intensities\nSelect a number of intensity columns as input for the absolute quantification. Each of them must represent a complete proteome (not individual fractions).\n\nThe default is to use the Intensity xyz columns in the proteinGroups.txt coming from MaxQuant.\nYou can also work with LFQ intensity xyz columns if you intend to compare resulting copy numbers across samples. Here, it is recommended to use ‘1’ as min. LFQ ratio count in MaxQuant and to change the averaging mode (see below).\nDo not use iBAQ values! These values are already normalized for protein size and using them as input will give you wrong results, as size-normalization will be applied again.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Logarithmized\nSpecify whether the intensities are logarithmized in the selected Intensities columns.\n\n\n2.1.4 Averaging mode\nThis parameter controls how different columns will be handled.\n\nAll columns separately: Each column will be treated independently. Any sample-to-sample normalization will be lost. Resulting copy numbers should only be compared within each sample, not across. This is useful if you want to analyse changes in cell sizes across conditions.\nSame normalization for all columns: The plugin will calculate the total protein mass per cell for all columns and then use the median thereof as scaling factor for all columns. Any sample-to-sample normalization will be retained. Therefore, this setting is useful in when working with LFQ intensities that are normalized for comparability across samples. Note that any changes in cell size across samples will not be represented.\nSame normalization within groups: as described for the previous option, but only within groups of samples.\nAverage all columns: Instead of reporting copy numbers for individual samples, only the median across all samples will be reported. This is useful if you are using a set of replicates as input.\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Molecular masses\nSelect the column containing the molecular masses of the proteins. This can either be the Molecular weight column from the MaxQuant output or one of the columns mapped by the Annotate proteins function.\n\n\n2.1.6 Detectability correction\nIn its simplest form, the plugin will assume linearity between the Intensity values and the cumulative mass of each protein. In other words, the molecular mass of each protein serves as the correction factor if one wants to calculate copy numbers. Alternatively, one can use other detectability correction factors, such as the number of theoretical peptides. In contrast to the molecular mass, this takes the combination of sequence features and the protease into account. Theoretical peptides are not reported by MaxQuant directly, but can be calculated using Annotate proteins.\n\n\n2.1.7 Scaling mode\nThere are two options of how to scale copy numbers globally:\n\nThe total protein amount per cell. In this case the total intensity will be considered proportional to the total protein amount per cell.\nThe histone proteomic ruler. Here, the cumulative histone amount will be considered proportional to the expected DNA amount per cell (calculated from the genome size and the user-defined ploidy.) Note that the organism will be auto-detected from the uniprot IDs.\n\n\n\n2.1.8 Total cellular protein concentration\nSpecify the total cellular protein concentration. This value is remarkably invariant across many cell types (typically between 200 and 300 g/l. If unknown, use the default value. This parameter is irrelevant for copy numbers, but will be used for concentration estimations."

If this is the case, we have good news for you. In almost all user cases the standard values of most parameters are fine and you only need to adjust a small number of factors. Typically there is only little information that you need to provide. Every parameter in the interface has context help which you obtain by hovering with the mouse pointer over the text string for this parameter. This documentation also has that information, and more.\nYou will have to tell MaxQuant where to find your raw data files and your fasta files, and which labels and digestion enzymes you are using. 90% of the time that will be enough, and you can leave the rest of the bells and whistles on their default values. Of course, we are assuming you have successfully installed and started MaxQuant, and that you can find the Start button once you have finished entering the processing parameters (hint: look in the lower left corner of the GUI). Below are more details on how to enter those four most important parameters:"

    "text": "5.1 In-Vivo Quantitative Proteomics Reveals a Key Contribution of Post-Transcriptional Mechanisms to the Circadian Regulation of Liver Metabolism\nThe algorithms were first applied in 2014 by Robles et. al.1.\nAbstract\nCircadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that drive the rhythmic expression of a broad array of genes, orchestrating metabolism and physiology. Recent evidence indicates that post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play essential roles in modulating temporal gene expression for proper circadian function, particularly for the molecular mechanism of the clock. Due to technical limitations in large-scale, quantitative protein measurements, it remains unresolved to what extent the circadian clock regulates metabolism by driving rhythms of protein abundance. Therefore, we aimed to identify global circadian oscillations of the proteome in the mouse liver by applying in vivo SILAC mouse technology in combination with state of the art mass spectrometry. Among the 3000 proteins accurately quantified across two consecutive cycles, 6% showed circadian oscillations with a defined phase of expression. Interestingly, daily rhythms of one fifth of the liver proteins were not accompanied by changes at the transcript level. The oscillations of almost half of the cycling proteome were delayed by more than six hours with respect to the corresponding, rhythmic mRNA. Strikingly we observed that the length of the time lag between mRNA and protein cycles varies across the day. Our analysis revealed a high temporal coordination in the abundance of proteins involved in the same metabolic process, such as xenobiotic detoxification. Apart from liver specific metabolic pathways, we identified many other essential cellular processes in which protein levels are under circadian control, for instance vesicle trafficking and protein folding. Our large-scale proteomic analysis reveals thus that circadian post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play a key role in the temporal orchestration of liver metabolism and physiology."

    "section": "4.1 Support vector machines",
    "text": "4.1 Support vector machines\nSupport vector machines (SVMs) were largely developed in the 1990s by Vapnik and co-workers on a basis of a separable bipartition problem at the AT & T Bell Laboratories (see2. SVMs are a family of data analysis algorithms, based on convex quadratic programming, whose successful use has been demonstrated in classification, regression and clustering problems. Thus, SVMs are now the state-of-the-art tools for non-linear input-output knowledge. The following section covers a brief and basic description of SVMs, but detailed explanations can be found in V. N. Vapniks3, N. Cristianinis and J. Shawe-Taylors4, V. N. Vapniks5, V. N. Vapniks6, B. E. Bosers, I. M. Guyons, and V. N. Vapniks7.\nSVMs are a particular class of supervised learning methods that are well suited for analyses of data in high-dimensional feature spaces. They are computationally efficient and capable of detecting biologically-relevant signals. SVMs revolve around the notion of a margin - either side of a data separating linear decision boundary (hyperplane). Maximizing this margin and thereby creating the largest distance between two classes as well as between the hyperplane and the instances on either side, is the main task in training SVMs (see figure below). Thus, these models have a binary nature to separate classes, but can be extended to multi-class problems by reducing the problem to a set of multiple binary classification problems. The hyperplane is defined by:\n \\[\\begin{align}\nD(x)  =  &lt;\\omega,x&gt;  +  b\n\\end{align}\\] \nwhere \\(ω\\) is the weights vector and \\(b\\) is a bias value (or \\(−b\\) the threshold).\nIn case an optimal separating hyperplane is found, data points on the margin are known as support vectors and the solution is a linear combination of them (red data points in figure below). Each new data point is then classified according to its optimal position relative to the model’s hyperplane. So the model complexity is unaffected by the number of features encountered in the training data, therefore SVMs are well suited to deal with learning tasks with a large number of features compared to the number of data points. In case no hyperplane can be found, the problem can be addressed using the so-called soft margin. The margin optimization constraints can be relaxed by allowing some misclassifications or margin violations in the training set, to get better generalization of the SVM than using a hard margin. The choice of appropriate penalties is mandatory:\n \\[\\begin{align}\nmin_{\\omega,b,\\xi} ~& \\frac{1}{2} \\ \\omega^{T}\\omega \\ + \\ C\\sum_{i=1}^{l}\\xi_{i} \\\\\n\\text{subject to} ~& y_{i}(\\omega^{T}x_{i}+b) \\ &lt; \\ 1-\\xi_{i} \\ \\ \\text{and} \\ \\ \\xi \\geq 0\n\\end{align}\\] \nwhere \\(\\omega\\) is the weights vector, \\(b\\) is a bias value, \\(C\\) is a penalty constant, and \\(\\xi\\) is a slack variable, which is the orthogonal distance between a data point and the hyperplane. Large C correspond to large penalties for misclassification and resemble a hard margin classifier, whereas \\(\\xi\\) measures the degree of misclassification or margin violation. This is a good way to deal with outliers in the data set without destroying the model by tailoring it perfectly to the input data.\nNevertheless, most real-world data sets involve separation problems that are linearly non-separable, which requires the definition of complex functions to build a good classifier. SVMs use kernels, a special class of functions to deal with such situations. Mapping the data points to a higher-dimensional space (transformed feature space) using kernels, enables the definition of a linear hyperplane, which results in a non-linear hyperplane in the original space. The hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional space are represented by all points defining a set, whose inner product with a vector is constant in that space. Training the classifier depends only on the data through dot products, which are possible to compute even at a high-dimension at low cost by applying the so-called kernel trick. The trick lies in working in an higher-dimensional space, without ever explicitly transforming the original data points into that space, but instead relying on algorithms that only need to compute inner products within that space. These algorithms are identical to kernels and can thus be cheaply computed in the original space. So, everything about linear cases can also be applied to non-linear ones using an appropriate kernel function. It is common practice to find the best suiting function by cross-validation. Some popular kernels, which are all included in Perseus, are:\n \\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{linear:} \\ K(x,y)         &= x^{T}y  \\\\\n\\text{sigmoid:} \\ K(x,y)    &= tanh(\\gamma x^{T}y \\ + \\ r) \\\\\n\\text{radial basis:} \\ K(x,y)   &= \\exp(-\\gamma|x \\ - \\ y|^{2}) , \\ \\gamma &gt; 0 \\\\\n\\text{polynomial:} \\ K(x,y)     &= (\\gamma x^{T}y \\ + \\ r)^{d}, \\ \\gamma &gt; 0\n\\end{align}\\] \nwhere \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two data points, \\(\\gamma\\) is the slope, \\(d\\) is the degree of the polynom, and \\(r\\) is a constant.\n\n\n\nIllustration of separating two classes using SVMs. Linear (A.) and non-linear (B.) perfect separation of two classes (green and orange) with a hyperplane (black) and maximal margin (blue and dotted gray lines). Support vectors defining the hyperplane are in red. No misclassifiactions or margin violations are included.\n\n\nFor more information you can also consult Wikipedia."

It was developed by R.A. Fisher, a professor of statistics at University College London, and is sometimes called Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA). Its first description was in 1936 and can be found in8.\nThe primary purpose of LDA is to separate samples of two or multiple distinct groups while preserving as much of the class discriminatory information as possible to classify new unseen instances. The approach of the LDA is to project all the data points into new space, normally of lower dimension, which maximizes the between-class separability while minimizing their within-class variability. So the goal is to find the best projection axes for separating the classes. In general the number of axes that can be computed by the LDA method is one less than the number of classes in the problem.\n\n\n\nIllustration of separating two classes using LDA. Classes are separated perfectly and the dimensionality of the problem has been reduced from two features (x1,x2) to only a scalar value y.\n\n\nFor more information you can also consult Wikipedia."

    "text": "4.3 k-nearest neighbors\nK-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) is a simple lazy learner algorithm that stores all available data points and classifies new instances based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). It corresponds to the group of supervised learning algorithms and has been used in statistical estimation and pattern recognition already in the beginning of 1970’s as a non-parametric technique. During the training phase the algorithm simply stores the data points including their class labels and all computation is deferred until the classification process. So kNN is based on the principle that instances that are in close proximity to another have similar properties. Thus, to classify new unclassified instances, one simply has to look at their k-nearest neighbors, to figure out the classification label. The class membership can be defined by a majority vote of the k closest neighbors or the neighbors can be ranked and weighted according to their distance to the new instance. A common weighting scheme consists in giving each neighbor a weight of 1/d, where d is the distance to the neighbor.\n\n\n\nIllustration of classifying a new item using kNN. Using a majority vote of the k nearest neighbors, the defined k can change the assigned class of the red star. If k = 3 (purple circle) the star corresponds to the blue polygon class, because the three closest neighbors include two blue polygons and one green rectangle. Whereas, if k = 5 (black circle) the star is assigned to the green class, because the five closest neighbors include more green rectangles than blue polygons (three green rectangles vs. two blue polygons).\n\n\nFor more information you can also consult Wikipedia."

    "text": "5.1 In-Vivo Quantitative Proteomics Reveals a Key Contribution of Post-Transcriptional Mechanisms to the Circadian Regulation of Liver Metabolism\nThe algorithms were first applied in 2014 by Robles et. al.1.\nAbstract\nCircadian clocks are endogenous oscillators that drive the rhythmic expression of a broad array of genes, orchestrating metabolism and physiology. Recent evidence indicates that post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play essential roles in modulating temporal gene expression for proper circadian function, particularly for the molecular mechanism of the clock. Due to technical limitations in large-scale, quantitative protein measurements, it remains unresolved to what extent the circadian clock regulates metabolism by driving rhythms of protein abundance. Therefore, we aimed to identify global circadian oscillations of the proteome in the mouse liver by applying in vivo SILAC mouse technology in combination with state of the art mass spectrometry. Among the 3000 proteins accurately quantified across two consecutive cycles, 6% showed circadian oscillations with a defined phase of expression. Interestingly, daily rhythms of one fifth of the liver proteins were not accompanied by changes at the transcript level. The oscillations of almost half of the cycling proteome were delayed by more than six hours with respect to the corresponding, rhythmic mRNA. Strikingly we observed that the length of the time lag between mRNA and protein cycles varies across the day. Our analysis revealed a high temporal coordination in the abundance of proteins involved in the same metabolic process, such as xenobiotic detoxification. Apart from liver specific metabolic pathways, we identified many other essential cellular processes in which protein levels are under circadian control, for instance vesicle trafficking and protein folding. Our large-scale proteomic analysis reveals thus that circadian post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms play a key role in the temporal orchestration of liver metabolism and physiology."

You may run MaxQuant using Graphical User Interface. MaxQuant on Linux doesn’t support the use of a GUI at the moment. We’re planning to make it available in future versions, so stay tuned to our newletter, where we’ll inform our users about new updates.\nThis tutorial is focused on running MaxQuant using the command-line.\n\nInstall .NET Core 8.0 To find out whether you already have it, type in the command line\n\ndotnet --version\nIf you see at least version \\(8.0.302\\), then everything is ready to start MaxQuant.\nOtherwise you need to follow the installation instructions at .NET Core SDK 8.0 for your operating system.\n\n2.2.1 Global installation on Ubuntu using sudo permissions\nUbuntu 22.04 (for example)\nwget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb\nsudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb\nsudo apt-get update; \\\nsudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https && \\\nsudo apt-get update && \\\nsudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0\n\n\n2.2.2 local installation using the conda environment\nAn alternative installation method, which might work better, if no sudo rights are available for the user would be to use the conda1 environment.\nDepending on your architecture, the user must choose between the x86 and the Arm installation scripts. Both can be downloaded from the anaconda repository using the wget command.\n# Or use conda to install an environment\n## get the installer \nmkdir -p ~/miniconda3\n# for 64x-bit 86x architecture\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\n# for 64-bit arm architecture\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-aarch64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\n\n### You'll only need one the above two scripts!!!\n\n# Install the conda base env\nbash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3\nrm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\nBefore one can use the conda environment in your shell, it must be initialized and the session restarted. Another tip would be to install the mamba package, but this is only optional and is not needed, if you’re using conda on a regular basis. (If you do, you probably already installed mamba 😀).\n# initialize conda on bash \n~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash\n~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh\n# logging out and back in again\nconda install conda-forge::mamba\nmamba init \n#Here again, one must log out and back in again for mamba to be active. \nNow, using the mambacommand one can create a new environment for dotnet. One can either choose a specific version for dotnet or by omitting the version number, the latest available version on the anaconda repository will be installed. You can search here for possible versions.\nBefore you can use the tool, you must activate the environment. Last check to see if the installation was successful, one can check for the available dotnet version.\n#Now we create `dotnet` env\n# create the dotnet env\nmamba create -n dotnet8 conda-forge::dotnet=8.0.302\nmamba activate dotnet8\n#To test that we do have `dotnet`\ndotnet --version\n\n\n2.2.3 Scripted installation using Microsoft resources.\nOne can also follows Microsoft’s instruction to install the (optional) latest version of.NET by following the script here.\nA manual install has more options to choose from using the dotnet-install script from the .NET page.\nwget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O dotnet-install.sh\nchmod +x ./dotnet-install.sh\n./dotnet-install.sh --channel 8.0\nPossible important options here are:\n\n--channel - use this to ask for a specific version and/or subversion\n--version - install a specific version\n--install-dir - use this to specify the path to the installation directory.\n\nWe also added a script for an automated installation of the .NET which can also be downloaded here. Running the script will ask the user for a download location, where, for now, .NET version 8.0.302 will be installed. This version was needed due to a bug in Perseus.\nAfter downloading the script it needs to be made executable and can be run as such:\nchmod -x Install_dotnet.sh\nsh Install_dotnet.sh INSTALLATION_PATH/\nThis will download the .NET installation script from Microsoft and will install the tool at the given path. no sudo rights are needed."

    "text": "1 Repository\nThe code of the plugins is maintained at the perseus-plugins repository\nIf you do not need to examine or contribute to the source code, a more convenient portal with basic information about plugin development can be found at our plug-In store, where the software can be downloaded after registration.\nThese will unpack to a folder named JurgenCox-perseus-plugins-6e9f957 (or similar). The c-sharp source code implementing the standard activities (i.e. plugins) are found in the folders under PerseusPluginLib.\n\n\n2 API\nIf you wish to program your own plugin, the api you need to program against is found under PerseusApi.Matrix. An activity/plugin must implement (currently) one of the five matrix activity interfaces, IMatrixAnalysis, IMatrixExport, IMatrixMultiProcessing, IMatrixProcessing, and IMatrixUpload. All of these are derived from IMatrixActivity, which is nothing more than a marker interface indicating activities that operate on IMatrixData. IActivity is a simple interface derived from INamedListItem with only three methods:\n\nHasButton { get; }\nint GetMaxThreads(Parameters parameters)\nstring Url { get; }\n\nIMatrixData : IData\nIMatrixActivity : IActivity\n\nIMatrixAnalysis : IMatrixActivity, IAnalysis\nIMatrixExport : IMatrixActivity, IExport\nIMatrixMultiProcessing : IMatrixActivity, IMultiProcessing\nIMatrixProcessing : IMatrixActivity, IProcessing\nIMatrixUpload : IMatrixActivity, IUpload\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the simplicity of the activity interfaces, the IMatrixData interface is very rich. Its documentation text reads,\n\nThe data structure representing an augmented data matrix which is the main data object that is flowing through the Perseus workflow. Note that plugin programmers are not supposed to write implementations of //IMatrixData//. The interface only serves to encapsulate the complexity of the implementation for the purpose of plugin programming.\nThe IMatrixData interface specifies 5 signatures of the void SetData method. Most of the parameters are the same in each signature. The ones which are not are written in bold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring name\n\n\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; expressionColumnNames\nfloat[,] expressionValues\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; stringColumnNames\nList&lt;string[]&gt; stringColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryColumnNames\nList&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; multiNumericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[][]&gt; multiNumericColumns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring name\n\n\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; expressionColumnNames\nfloat[,] expressionValues\n\n\nbool[,]isImputed\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; stringColumnNames\nList&lt;string[]&gt; stringColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryColumnNames\nList&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; multiNumericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[][]&gt; multiNumericColumns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring name\n\n\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; expressionColumnNames\nfloat[,] expressionValues\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; stringColumnNames\nList&lt;string[]&gt; stringColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryColumnNames\nList&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; multiNumericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[][]&gt; multiNumericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryRowNames\nList&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryRows\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericRowNames\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericRows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring name\n\n\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; expressionColumnNames\nfloat[,] expressionValues\n\n\nbool[,] isImputed\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; stringColumnNames\nList&lt;string[]&gt; stringColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryColumnNames\nList&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; multiNumericColumnNames\nList&lt;double[][]&gt; multiNumericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryRowNames\nList&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryRows\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericRowNames\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericRows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstring name\nstring description\n\n\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; expressionColumnNames\nList&lt;string&gt; expressionColumnDescriptions\nfloat[,] expressionValues\n\n\nbool[,] isImputed\n\n\n\n\nfloat[,] qualityValues\nstring qualityName\nbool qualityBiggerIsBetter\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; stringColumnNames\nList&lt;string&gt; stringColumnDescriptions\nList&lt;string[]&gt; stringColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryColumnNames\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryColumnDescriptions | List&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryColumns\n\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericColumnNames\nList&lt;string&gt; numericColumnDescriptions\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; multiNumericColumnNames\nList&lt;string&gt; multiNumericColumnDescriptions\nList&lt;double[][]&gt; multiNumericColumns\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryRowNames\nList&lt;string&gt; categoryRowDescriptions\nList&lt;string[][]&gt; categoryRows\n\n\nList&lt;string&gt; numericRowNames\n`List&lt;string&gt; numericRowDescriptions\nList&lt;double[]&gt; numericRows\n\n\n\nThe pattern is that a data matrix, in its simplest form, can have 5 types of columns: expression, string, category, numeric, and multinumeric. The List type of the column names, and, except for expressions, of the values, reflects the fact that there may be multiple columns of any given type. Since for any given column, each row has its own value, the values are lists (col) of arrays (row). Two value types, categories and multiNumeric, are lists of 2d arrays, because any given element (col,row) may have multiple categories or numbers. The 2d array nature of isImputed mirrors that of expressionValues because each entry for an expression has either been imputed or not."
