<p>The summary file contains summary information for all the raw files processed with a single MaxQuant run. The summary information consists of some MaxQuant parameters, information of the raw file contents, and statistics on the peak detection. Based on this file a quick overview can be gathered on the quality of the data in the raw file.</p>
<p>The last row in this file contains the summary information for each column on each of the processed files.</p>
